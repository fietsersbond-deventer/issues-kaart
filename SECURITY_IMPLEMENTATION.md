# HTML Sanitization Security Implementation

## Overview
This project now has comprehensive HTML sanitization implemented for the POST and PATCH endpoints for issues, protecting against XSS attacks while preserving valid Quill editor content.

## Implementation Details

### 1. HTML Sanitization Utility (`server/utils/sanitizeHtml.ts`)
- Uses DOMPurify with JSDOM for server-side HTML sanitization
- Configured to allow only HTML elements that match the Quill editor toolbar
- Removes all dangerous content including scripts, event handlers, and malicious URLs

### 2. Protected Endpoints
- `POST /api/issues` - Sanitizes description field before database insertion
- `PATCH /api/issues/[id]` - Sanitizes description field when updating issues

### 3. Allowed HTML Elements (matching Quill editor)
- Headers: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`
- Text formatting: `strong`, `b`, `em`, `i`, `span`
- Links and images: `a`, `img`
- Lists: `ol`, `ul`, `li`
- Paragraphs and breaks: `p`, `br`
- Indentation: `blockquote`

### 4. Security Features
- Removes all `<script>` tags
- Strips event handlers (`onclick`, `onerror`, etc.)
- Blocks `javascript:` and `data:` URLs
- Removes form elements (`form`, `input`, `button`)
- Blocks dangerous elements (`iframe`, `object`, `embed`)
- Handles malformed HTML gracefully

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite (27 tests)
Run tests with: `pnpm test`

#### Test Categories:
1. **Basic Sanitization** (4 tests)
   - Validates that allowed Quill editor elements are preserved
   
2. **XSS Prevention** (8 tests)
   - Script injection prevention
   - Event handler removal
   - Dangerous URL blocking
   
3. **Advanced XSS Attack Vectors** (7 tests)
   - SVG-based attacks
   - CSS expression attacks
   - Iframe injection
   - Meta tag injection
   - HTML entity encoding bypasses
   
4. **Edge Cases** (6 tests)
   - Empty/null input handling
   - Non-string input handling
   - Malformed HTML handling
   
5. **Quill Editor Specific** (2 tests)
   - Ensures all toolbar elements are allowed
   - Verifies disallowed elements are removed

## Security Benefits
- ✅ Prevents XSS attacks through HTML content
- ✅ Maintains user experience by preserving valid formatting
- ✅ Server-side validation ensures security regardless of client-side changes
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage validates security measures
- ✅ Uses industry-standard DOMPurify library

## Usage
The sanitization is automatically applied to all issue descriptions:
- When creating new issues via POST
- When updating issue descriptions via PATCH
- No changes required in frontend code
